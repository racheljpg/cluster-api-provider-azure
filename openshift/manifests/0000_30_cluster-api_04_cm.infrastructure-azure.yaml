                      This is only a subset of options that are available in azure cloud provider config.
                      Some values for the cloud provider config are inferred from other parts of cluster api provider azure spec, and may not be available for overrides.

                      Note: All cloud provider config values can be customized by creating the secret beforehand. CloudProviderConfigOverrides is only used when the secret is managed by the Azure Provider.

                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

                      FailureDomains specifies the list of unique failure domains for the location/region of the cluster.
                      A FailureDomain maps to Availability Zone with an Azure Region (if the region support them). An
                      Availability Zone is a separate data center within a region and they can be used to ensure
                      the cluster is more resilient to failure.
                      See: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview
                      This list will be used by Cluster API to try and spread the machines across the failure domains.

                              Some values for the cloud provider config are inferred from other parts of cluster api provider azure spec, and may not be available for overrides.

                          ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
                          users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.


                          ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template` and `MachineSet.Template`,
                          which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
                          and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies
                          the API and some issues that can impact user experience.


                          During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
                          for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,
                          specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`.
                          The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version
                          when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.


                          In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`
                          had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
                          The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`
                          which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.


                          In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded
                          types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.

                                  If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                  should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                  For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                  "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                                  index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
